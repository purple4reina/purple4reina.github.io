## Comments

This was another straightforward problem. It came down to looping through all
primes and storing their squares. If the reverse of one of these prime squares
has already been seen, then it is a reversible prime square.

Using a sieve to create the primes, gets the answer in roughly 8 seconds with
Python 3.10.8.


## Code

```python
def sieve(top):
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime:
            continue
        yield p
        num = p * p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p

def reverse(n):
    k = 0
    while n:
        n, mod = divmod(n, 10)
        k = 10 * k + mod
    return k

def solve(n):
    total = count = 0
    seen = {}
    for prime in sieve(31100101):
        squ = prime ** 2
        num = reverse(squ)
        if num in seen:
            total += num + squ
            count += 2
            if count >= n:
                return total
        seen[squ] = True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
