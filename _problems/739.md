## Comments

It ended up being quite significant that they gave the first example of how the
triangle works using a seed row of all 1's.  The left most values of each row
in this triangle end up forming the [Catalan
numbers](https://oeis.org/A000108).  I loved how that page started

Cuz ho boy is that entry long!  I was honestly surprised that I hadn't stumbled
upon it earlier with all these problems I've been completing.

The challenge in this problem was that we needed an answer using a Catalan
transform.  Basically a seed row of different values.  That led me to [this pdf
on Catalan transforms](https://oeis.org/A001517/a001517.pdf) also from
oeis.org.  In this document they give two ways to calculate a Catalan
transform.  The first way is what I have implemented here.  The second was what
I found myself doing initially, recursively calculating each line of the
triangle until reaching the bottom row.  That is incredible inefficient, at
complexity $$O(n^2)$$.  However, this solution is linear, aka $$O(n)$$.  The
biggest bottleneck in my final implementation is the speed of finding the
modular inverse of each number below $$n$$.

Runs in about 42 seconds with Pypy3.

## Code

```python
modulo = 1000000007

def series(l):
    a, b, s = 1, 3, []
    for _ in range(l):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulo
        s.append(a)
    return s

def inv(n):
    t, newt = 0, 1
    r, newr = modulo, n
    while newr:
        q = r // newr
        t, newt = newt, t - q * newt
        r, newr = newr, r - q * newr
    return t

def solve(n):

    fact = [1] * (2*n)
    for i in range(1, 2*n):
        fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % modulo

    total = 0
    ser = series(n - 1)
    const = (inv(fact[n - 2]) * inv(n - 1)) % modulo
    for k in range(n - 1):
        total += fact[n + k - 2] * inv(fact[k]) * \
                (n - k - 1) * ser[n - k - 2] * const

    return total % modulo

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
