## Comments

For this problem I created all the admissible numbers below $n$ using a sieve.
Next it was just a matter of finding the next largest prime number which I did
using a combination of the sieve and list of primes both created earlier.

After a certain point, there are no more admissible numbers to be found.  We
could stop the sieve at this point, but going up until $\sqrt n$ means we will
have enough primes at our disposal in the next step where we must find the next
prime after a given number.  If we stop sieving too soon, this could make
things more difficult later on.

I keep thinking there has got to be a way to either make my code cleaner or
speed up the algorithm here. However, running in under half a second in Pypy3
seems optimal enough.

## Code

```python
def solve(n):

    if n < 3:
        return 0

    top = int(n ** 0.5) + 1
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    primes = []
    new_admissibles, all_admissibles, admissibles = [], [], [1]
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime:
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p * p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p
        for a in admissibles:
            num = a * p
            while num < n:
                new_admissibles.append(num)
                num *= p
        all_admissibles.extend(new_admissibles)
        admissibles, new_admissibles = new_admissibles, []
    admissibles = all_admissibles

    def pseudo_fortunate(k):
        i = k + 2
        while i <= top:
            if sieve[i]:
                return i - k
            i += 1

        while True:
            for p in primes:
                if i % p == 0:
                    break
            else:
                return i - k
            i += 1

    pseudos = {3: True}
    for k in admissibles:
        pseudos[pseudo_fortunate(k)] = True
    return sum(pseudos)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
