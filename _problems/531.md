## Comments

This problem was pretty fun!  I was very grateful for the problem's name.  I
knew it was a hint, so once I got a working brute force algorithm, I looked it
up.  Low and behold, it was all about the _Chinese Remainder Theorem_.  I feel
like I still struggle to really grok problems that have modulo arithmetic, like
this one.  But, one article lead me to another and another and eventually I
found myself implementing the extended Euclidean algorithm for the greatest
common denominator, combining that with BÃ©zout's identity, and getting myself
the answer.

It feels like there's a lot more code here that needed.  Most of it went toward
calculating Euler's totient: generating primes, a memoization wrapper, and the
actual totient function.

Runs in about 5 seconds with Pypy3.

## Code

```python
_stop = int(1005000 ** 0.5)
_sieve = [False, False] + [True] * _stop
_primes = []
for p, is_pr in enumerate(_sieve):
    if not is_pr:
        continue
    _primes.append(p)
    n = p + p
    while n <= _stop:
        _sieve[n] = False
        n += p

def cache(fn):
    _cache = {}
    def wrap(*args):
        if args in _cache:
            return _cache[args]
        ret = fn(*args)
        _cache[args] = ret
        return ret
    return wrap

@cache
def totient(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    top = n ** 0.5
    for p in _primes:
        if p > top:
            break
        if n % p == 0:
            n //= p
            e = 1
            while n % p == 0:
                n //= p
                e += 1
            return p ** e * (1 - 1/p) * totient(n)
    return n - 1

def g(a, n, b, m):
    r, s, t = gcd(n, m)
    if a%r != b%r:
        return 0
    return (a*t*m + b*s*n) % (n * m) // r

def gcd(a, b):
    old_r, r = a, b
    old_s, s = 1, 0
    old_t, t = 0, 1

    while r:
        quotient = old_r // r
        old_r, r = r, old_r - quotient * r
        old_s, s = s, old_s - quotient * s
        old_t, t = t, old_t - quotient * t

    return old_r, old_s, old_t

def f(n, m):
    return g(int(totient(n)), n, int(totient(m)), m)

def solve(bottom=1000000, top=1005000):
    total= 0
    for n in range(bottom, top):
        for m in range(n + 1, top):
            total += f(n, m)
    return int(total)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    m = eval(sys.argv[2])
    print(solve(n, m))
```

def test_g(n, expect):
    assert expect == g(*n)
