## Comments

Another relatively straightforward problem. This was because much simpler when
doing the problems in logarithms rather than powers because computers are much
faster at calculating large logarithms than they are in calculating large
powers.

We are looking for all values where

$$800800^{800800}>p^qq^p$$

which is equivalent to

$$800800\log {800800}>q\log p+p\log q$$

I estimated the value for the largest prime required $p$ assuming that $q=2$.

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
800800^{800800}&=2^qq^2 \\
\log({800800^{800800}})&=q\log2+2\log q \\
\end{alignat}$$

Since the value $q\log2$ will generally be larger than $2\log q$, I reduced the
problem to the estimate

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
\log({800800^{800800}})&=q\log2 \\
\frac{\log({800800^{800800}})}{\log2}&=q \\
\end{alignat}$$

I used that value, which was roughly $15$ million, and used a sieve to get all
required primes.

From here it was just a matter of doing the searching. I could have made it
more efficient as this code searches for all approximately $1$ billion
solutions. Code runs in 200 seconds using Python 3.10.8.

## Code

```python
import math

def sieve(top):
    sieve = [False, False] + [True] * (top - 1)
    primes = []
    for p, isprime in enumerate(sieve):
        if not isprime:
            continue
        primes.append(p)
        num = p * p
        while num <= top:
            sieve[num] = False
            num += p
    return primes

def solve(n):
    logn = math.log(n)
    top = int(logn / math.log(2)) + 1
    primes = sieve(top)
    lenprimes = len(primes)
    count = 0
    for i in range(lenprimes - 1):
        p = primes[i]
        logp = math.log(p)
        for j in range(i + 1, lenprimes):
            q = primes[j]
            if q*logp + p*math.log(q) <= logn:
                count += 1
            elif j == i + 1:
                return count
            else:
                break

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        pytest.param(800**1, 2, id='800**1'),
        pytest.param(800**2, 5, id='800**2'),
        pytest.param(800**3, 10, id='800**3'),
        pytest.param(800**4, 13, id='800**3'),
        pytest.param(800**800, 10790, id='800**800'),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
