## Comments

This was a really interesting problem!  I don't think I've ever solved an
infinitely polynomial series like this before so I definitely learned something
new.  Which is super awesome.

I did some research about how to solve these infinite polynomial series.  I
found that $\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n=\frac1{1-x}$.  That didn't apply here, but what
was interesting was how this solution was derived.  I then used a similar
method to figure out the answer to this $A(x)$. Let $F(n)$ be the Fibonacci
sequence with $F(0)=0$, $F(1)=1$, and $F(2)=1$:

$$A(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty F(n)\,x^n=x+x^2+2x^3+3x^4+5x^5+8x^6+\dots$$

Multiply each side by $x$:

$$x\,A(x)=x^2+x^3+2x^4+3x^5+5x^6+\dots$$

Add $A(x)$ and $x\,A(x)$ together

$$(x+1)\,A(x)=x+2x^2+3x^3+5x^4+8x^5+13x^6+\dots$$

Multiply each side by $x$ again:

$$x(x+1)\,A(x)=x^2+2x^3+3x^4+5x^5+8x^6+\dots{}=A(x)-x$$

Rearranging:

$$A(x)\,x^2+\left(A(x)+1\right)x-A(x)=0$$

And since we know $A(x)$ and are solving for $x$, we can use the quadradic
formula to solve for $x$.  This means that for $x$ to be rational, then the
determinant must be a perfect square.  This allows us to find all the values of
$A(x)$ for which $x$ is rational.

Since I knew the value of $A(x)$ would probably be pretty large, I looked for a
pattern in the values of the determinant for which $x$ was rational.  These
numbers followed the pattern in
[https://oeis.org/A033889](https://oeis.org/A033889).  It was from here that I
was able to get the answer.

## Code

```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 3:
        return 1
    f1 = f2 = 1
    for _ in range(n - 2):
        f1, f2 = f2, f1 + f2
    return f2

def solve(n):
    d = fib(4*n + 1)
    return int((5*d**2 - 4)**0.5 - 1) // 5

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (1, 2),
        (10, 74049690),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
