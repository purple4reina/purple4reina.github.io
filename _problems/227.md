## Comments

As with the last problem that I solved, I sought out a problem that could be
solved using linear algebra.

This problem is another random walks problem.  This time there are two objects
moving through the system and there are _absorbing states_, locations at which
the object cannot move out of.

The first challenge I needed to overcome was how to represent the two
objects moving through a single system.  In the end, I settled on each entry in
the transition matrix representing the single state where object one is in
location $a$ and object two is in location $b$.

I did some research on Markov chains with absorbing states.  The Wikipedia
article on [Absorbing Markov
chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbing_Markov_chain#Fundamental_matrix)
was very helpful. It described how to find the fundamental matrix $N$ by first
finding matrix $Q$. The latter is the normal transition matrix for the system,
minus the rows and columns representing absorbing states. Therefore, the matrix
$Q^n$ gives the probability of transitioning from one non-absorbing state to
another after $n$ turns. Our fundamental matrix $N$ is the sum of all powers of
$Q$.

$$N=\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty Q^k$$

Notice how similar this sum is to the geometric sequence

$$n=\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty q^k=\frac{1}{1-q}=(1-q)^{-1}$$

It follows that $N=(I-Q)^{-1}$.  The final solution is the row sum of the row
that represents the starting state where the dice are on opposite sides of the
table.

I wish my program was faster.  Currently runs in about 20 seconds with Python
v3.9.6.  Most of the time is taken up in the `numpy.array` allocation on line
8.

## Code

```python
import numpy

def q(n):
    def place(to_i, to_j, val):
        to_i, to_j = to_i%n, to_j%n
        row[to_i*n+to_j] += val

    P = numpy.array([[0] * n**2 for _ in range(n**2)])
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == j:
                continue
            row = P[i*n+j]
            place(i,   j,  16)
            place(i+1, j,   4)
            place(i-1, j,   4)
            place(i,   j+1, 4)
            place(i,   j-1, 4)
            place(i+1, j+1, 1)
            place(i+1, j-1, 1)
            place(i-1, j+1, 1)
            place(i-1, j-1, 1)

    mask = [i*n+i for i in range(n)]
    P = numpy.delete(P, mask, 0)
    P = numpy.delete(P, mask, 1)

    return P / 36

def solve(n):
    I = numpy.identity(n**2-n)
    Q = q(n)
    N = numpy.linalg.inv(I - Q)

    starting_row = N[n//2-1]
    expected = sum(starting_row)
    return round(expected, 6)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```
