## Comments

It's been a while since I'd worked on a problem, so I decided to pull one out.
Figured that given how much time has passed since I last completed one,
there'll be a couple easy problems to tackle, this being one of them.

The trick here, that felt like it took me way to long to get to, is to only
search through the square numbers. For some reason I was trying to search
through all numbers below $$10^16$$ which clearly won't work. I also noticed
that the splits in the numbers was always as close to the middle as possible,
with the right side potentially getting the longer number. With those two
pieces of knowledge, it was easy to loop through all squares, split them down
the middle, and check the math.

Runs in less than 5 seconds with Pypy v3.10.13 on my macbook air.

## Code

```python
def solve(n):
    total = sqr = num = 0
    while num < 10 ** n:
        sqr += 1
        num = sqr ** 2

        snum = str(num)
        alen = len(snum) // 2
        if alen < 1:
            continue
        a = int(str(num)[:alen])
        bstr = str(num)[alen:]
        if bstr.startswith('0'):
            continue
        b = int(bstr)
        if a + b == sqr:
            total += num

    return total

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

## Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (4, 5131),
        (5, 93340),
        (6, 587549),
        (7, 12971262),
        (8, 176339975),
        (9, 970971595),
        (10, 13852403215),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
