## Comments

I just finished my upper divisional linear algebra course (I took a lower
divisional one back in high school) and wanted more practice with applications
that could be solved using matrices.

This problem is just a random walks problem.  I created a $900\times 900$
Markov matrix $A$, one row/column for each square in the grid.  Each $a_{i,j}$
entry in this matrix represent the probability a flea will jump from location
$i$ to location $j$.  Therefore, the transition matrix for this problem is
$A^n$ where $n$ is the number of times the fleas move positions.

I struggled a bit to figure out what to do with this matrix once I got it.  I
read several articles about random walks and though it helped, none of them
discussed situations where there were multiple walks going on at once.

To better understand the problem on my own, I then implemented a brute force
method.  This did two things.  It helped me see the relationship between matrix
$A$ and the number of empty squares.  It also helped me write several tests.

From here I was able to take these tests back to my matrix implementation and
get the final solution.  For each square on the grid, I needed to find the
probability that it will not have a flea on it.  Then, add these probabilities
together.

I used NumPy and it was blazingly fast.  The speed in which it found $A$ raised
to any power was nearly constant.  For that reason, I was even able to
calculate the expected number of empty squares after $1{,}000{,}000$ rings of
the bell.  After this many iterations, the system begins to find a steady
state.  A cool problem would have been to find the expected number of empty
squares after an infinite number of bell rings.  That would have been fun
because then I could have gotten practice with eigenvectors and eigenvalues!

Runs in about 0.6 seconds with Python 3.9.6.

## Code

```python
import numpy

def markov_matrix(grid_size, bells):

    def neighbors_of(m):
        row, col = divmod(m, grid_size)
        neighbors = []
        if row != 0:
            neighbors.append((row - 1, col))
        if row != grid_size - 1:
            neighbors.append((row + 1, col))
        if col != 0:
            neighbors.append((row, col - 1))
        if col != grid_size - 1:
            neighbors.append((row, col + 1))
        return neighbors

    matrix = [[0 for _ in range(grid_size**2)] for _ in range(grid_size**2)]
    for from_n in range(grid_size**2):
        neighbors = neighbors_of(from_n)
        prob = 1 / len(neighbors)
        for neighbor_i, neighbor_j in neighbors:
            to_n = grid_size*neighbor_i + neighbor_j
            matrix[to_n][from_n] = prob

    return numpy.linalg.matrix_power(matrix, bells)

def solve(grid_size, bells):
    markov, zeros = markov_matrix(grid_size, bells), 0
    for row in markov:
        prob = 1
        for col in row:
            prob -= prob * col
        zeros += prob
    return round(zeros, 6)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    m = eval(sys.argv[2])
    print(solve(n, m))
```
