## Comments

First day of spring!  Happy mathing and happy sunshine!

I get frustrated with myself when I can't figure out a problem.  I honestly
spent so many hours studying _roots of unity modulo n_ and modular arithmetic
in general.  At least two days this past week after work I spent all evening
(at least 5 hours each night) trying to figure it out.  No luck.  I kept
getting closer and closer with each try.

Instead, I decided to turn to a different approach.  Instead of throwing math
at the problem, I just threw a bunch of CPUs at it.  I figure the laptop I'm
working on has 16 cores and Python -- being just a single process -- will only
ever utilize one.  Golang on the other hand has _goroutines_ which by default
will take advantage of all its available CPUs.  This allowed me to do
computations 16 times faster.

I created 16 workers (this number chosen dynamically based on available CPU)
and then had each worker pull batches of numbers to process.  Some batches take
longer than others, so I kept the batch size relatively small which meant that
all 16 CPU were being used the entire time.

My algorithm was pretty brute force.  Given the equation $$b^2 \equiv 1
\pmod{n}$$, for each possible value of $$b$$ I went about calculating the
available values of $$n$$.  This is possible because $$b^2 = mn + 1$$ where
$$m$$ is an integer.

Reading through the forum afterward makes me even more frustrated with myself.
I'm sure I read all about the theorems that others used to solve this problem.
I guess I just wasn't able to put it together.  But, with time and practice,
I'm sure I'll be able to do it in the future.

Final Go code takes a couple hours to run.

**EDIT:** Looking back at the forums again, I see people referencing [Problem
407](407) and even just using the code they wrote for that problem in this one.
Well, I've gotta work on Problem 407 next then, I told myself, only to find out
I'd already solved it...  The first sentence in my write up from that problem
was

> I never really grokked this one, but I did end up getting the right answer.

Clearly.  Just shows me that I should really be taking the time after a tough
problem to go through the answers in the forum and really understand them.
That knowledge will certainly pay off later.  I'm gonna go back and do that
now...

## Python

### Code

```python
def solve(n):
    unity_roots = [0] * 3 + [1] * (n - 2)
    for b in range(n // 2 - 1, 2, -1):
        b2_1 = b**2 - 1
        for m in range((b - 2) // 2 + 1, 0, -1):
            num, mod = divmod(b2_1, m)
            if num > n:
                break
            if not mod:
                unity_roots[num] = num - b

    return sum(unity_roots)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    n = eval(sys.argv[1])
    print(solve(n))
```

### Tests

```python
import pytest
from problem import solve

_test_solve = (
        (10**1, 12),
        (10**2, 2044),
        (10**3, 278340),
        (10**4, 32246295),
        (10**5, 3493155809),
        #(10**6, 367567257265),
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize('n,expect', _test_solve)
def test_solve(n, expect):
    assert expect == solve(n)
```
